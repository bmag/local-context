# local-context
Generate elisp code to create frame-local features for Emacs

Does it bother you that some useful and popular features like Neotree and shell-pop don't support multiple contexts, e.g. you can't have two separate  Neotree buffers in two separate frames? Local-Context is here to help!

Local-Context genereates code that takes care of the hard work of handling different contexts. What is left for you to do is mostly adapt your code to context-local variables instead of global variables. More details coming soon.
